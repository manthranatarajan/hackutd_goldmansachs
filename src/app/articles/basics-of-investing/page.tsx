            <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Basics of Investing</h1>
            <p>Investing is a powerful tool for building wealth and achieving financial goals. Whether you're saving for retirement, a home, or your children's education, understanding the basics of investing can help you make informed decisions. Here are some key concepts to get you started:</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. What is Investing?</h2>
            <p>Investing involves allocating resources, usually money, in order to generate income or profit. Unlike saving, which typically involves putting money aside in a bank account with minimal risk and returns, investing carries a higher level of risk but also offers the potential for greater returns over time.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Types of Investments</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Buying shares of a company, which gives you ownership in that company. Stocks can provide dividends and capital appreciation.</li>
                <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Loans made to corporations or governments that pay interest over time. Bonds are generally considered safer than stocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutual Funds:</strong> Pooled funds from multiple investors that are managed by professionals to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and/or bonds.</li>
                <li><strong>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):</strong> Similar to mutual funds but traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks. They often have lower fees.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Investing in property for rental income or capital appreciation. Real estate can provide cash flow and tax benefits.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Risk and Return</h2>
            <p>The relationship between risk and return is fundamental to investing. Generally, higher potential returns come with higher risks. Understanding your risk tolerance—how much risk you are willing and able to take—is crucial in choosing the right investments for your portfolio.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. The Importance of Diversification</h2>
            <p>Diversification involves spreading your investments across different asset classes and sectors to reduce risk. By not putting all your eggs in one basket, you can minimize the impact of poor performance in any single investment.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Setting Investment Goals</h2>
            <p>Before you start investing, it's important to define your financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, buying a home, or funding education? Your goals will influence your investment strategy, including your time horizon and risk tolerance.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Starting Your Investment Journey</h2>
            <p>To begin investing, consider the following steps:</p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Educate yourself about different investment options.</li>
                <li>Determine your financial goals and risk tolerance.</li>
                <li>Create a budget that allows for regular contributions to your investment account.</li>
                <li>Choose an investment account (brokerage account, retirement account) based on your needs.</li>
                <li>Start small and gradually increase your investments as you become more comfortable.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Investing can be a rewarding way to build wealth over time. By understanding the basics of investing, including types of investments, risk management, diversification, and goal setting, you can make informed decisions that align with your financial objectives. Remember that investing is a long-term endeavor; patience and discipline are key components of successful investing.</p>
